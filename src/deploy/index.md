## Docker Compose Deployment (Recommended)

### Install

Download [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)

```bash
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/master/docker-compose.yml
```

Check if any configuration needs to be changed

```bash
$ vi docker-compose.yml  # or your favorite editor
```

Launch

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Open `http://{Server IP}:1200` in your browser, enjoy it! ✅

### Update

**Automatic Update**

Use [watchtower](https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower)

**Manual Update**

Update image

```bash
$ docker-compose pull
```

Restart container

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

### Configuration

Edit `environment` in [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)

## Docker Deployment

## Deploy to Fly.io

### Method 1: Fork

1.  [Fork RSSHub](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/fork) to your GitHub account;
2.  Clone the source code from your fork

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/<your username>/RSSHub.git
    $ cd RSSHub
    ```

3.  [Sign up for Fly.io](https://fly.io/app/sign-up) and install the [flyctl CLI](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/);
4.  Run `fly launch` and choose a unique name and region to deploy;
5.  Use `fly secrets set KEY=VALUE` to [configure some modules](config#route-specific-configurations);
6.  [Set up automatic deployment via GitHub Actions](https://fly.io/docs/app-guides/continuous-deployment-with-github-actions/);
7.  (Optional) Use `fly certs add your domain` to configure a custom domain, and follow the instructions to configure the related domain resolution at your DNS service provider (you can check the domain configuration status on the Dashboard Certificate page).

Upgrade: On the homepage of your Forked repository, click "Sync fork - Update Branch" to manually update to the latest official master branch, or install the [Pull](https://github.com/apps/pull) GitHub app to keep your fork synchronized with upstream.

### Method 2: Maintain fly.toml by yourself

1.  [Sign up for Fly.io](https://fly.io/app/sign-up) and install the [flyctl CLI](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/);
2.  Create a new empty directory locally, run `fly launch` in it, and choose a unique name and instance region;
3.  Edit the generated fly.toml file, add

   ```toml
   [build]
   image = "diygod/rsshub:latest"
   ```

   Depending on the actual situation, you may want to use other image tags, please read the relevant content of [Docker Image](#docker-image);
4.  Modify the `[env]` section in fly.toml or use `fly secrets set KEY=VALUE` to [configure some modules](config#route-specific-configurations);
5.  Execute `fly deploy` to start the application;
6.  (Optional) Use `fly certs add your domain` to configure a custom domain, and follow the instructions to configure the related domain resolution at your DNS service provider (you can check the domain configuration status on the Dashboard Certificate page).

Upgrade: Enter the directory where you saved the `fly.toml` file and execute `fly deploy` to trigger the steps of pulling the latest image and starting the upgraded application.

### Configure built-in Upstash Redis as cache

Run in the `RSSHub` folder

```bash
$ flyctl redis create
```

to create a new Redis database. Choose the same region as when you created the RSSHub app above, and it is recommended to enable [eviction](https://redis.io/docs/reference/eviction/). After creation, a string in the form of `redis://default:<password>@<domain>.upstash.io` will be printed.

Due to [a bug in a dependency](https://github.com/luin/ioredis/issues/1576), you currently need to append the `family=6` parameter to the URL provided by Fly.io, i.e., use `redis://default:<password>@<domain>.upstash.io/?family=6` as the connection URL.

Then configure the `[env]` section in fly.toml or run

```bash
$ fly secrets set CACHE_TYPE=redis REDIS_URL='<the connection URL>'
```

and execute `fly deploy` (if use the second install method) to trigger a redeployment to complete the configuration.

## Deploy to Sealos(use Redis as cache)

Automatic updates are included.
